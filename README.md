# Gewaechshaus

A project for our high school graduation. Feel free to use it!
We do not support it anymore. We also dont make a how to setup help, check out how we made it in the documentary.

## What our project is doing
We made a small greenhouse like a model to show how easily it is to full automate the process.

We meassure the temperature, earth humidity, air humidity, liquid levels and light income.
The greenhouse can now watering itself, heat itself up, cool it down, and hold a humidity.

We tested it over several weeks and the outputs were great. There is still some improvement but the alpha project is done!
